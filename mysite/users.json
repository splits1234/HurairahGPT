Basic Chemistry**  \n- Atomic structure, periodic table trends  \n- Chemical bonding (ionic, covalent, metallic)  \n- States of matter and phase changes  \n\n### **2. Chemical Reactions**  \n- Types of reactions (synthesis, decomposition, combustion, redox)  \n- Balancing equations  \n- Reaction kinetics and thermodynamics  \n\n### **3. Organic Chemistry**  \n- Hydrocarbons (alkanes, alkenes, alkynes)  \n- Functional groups (alcohols, carboxylic acids, esters)  \n- Reaction mechanisms (SN1, SN2, E1, E2)  \n\n### **4. Laboratory Techniques**  \n- Safe handling of chemicals  \n- Titration, distillation, chromatography  \n- Synthesis of common compounds (soap, esters, polymers)  \n\n### **5. Real-World Applications**  \n- Environmental chemistry (pollution, green chemistry)  \n- Biochemistry (enzymes, metabolism, DNA)  \n- Industrial processes (Haber process, electrolysis)  \n\nLet me know which topic interests you, and I\u2019ll provide a detailed explanation! \ud83e\uddea\ud83d\udd2c",
